In June 2023, I successfully completed the [OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP)](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/) certification. With the goal of documenting my journey to passing the exam, I thought I would create a repository of the most useful commands and information needed to prepare for the exam.

> Since the repository was created, it is possible that there have been variations in terms of exam methodology and topics covered.
