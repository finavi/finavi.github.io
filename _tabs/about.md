Hi, I am Vittorio and I have a master's degree in computer engineering with specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I have a passion for Cybersecurity, learned as a self-taught and have been working in this field for a few years. I am now employed as a Senior in a consulting company to perform Pentest on Web, Mobile and Infrastructure applications. 

In June 2023, I earned the Offensive Security Certified Professional, and with the purpose of helping those who want to take this path, I have created a repository that contains some of the most useful commands and guidance needed to prepare for the exam.

I am setting up this portfolio to keep track of my knowledge and have references in the future.

In my spare time I play sports as much as I can, and for some time a strange passion for chess has arisen.
